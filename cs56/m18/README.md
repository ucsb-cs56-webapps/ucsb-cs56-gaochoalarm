Potential of this project: GauchoAlarm looks simple and easy but actually it has much potential to be improved.
e.g.
From the aspect of development, it is a good idea to have a mechanicam of sleep&wakeup. We can use format method to make the program recognize the string of time and use heroku clock processes to make itself sleeping and wake up itself before the next alarm.

From the aspect of users, we can offers sharing features after creating alarm and joinning alarm.

More to implement:
- Sleep and Wakeup
- Sharing alarm
- Map: show the location of meeting
- Phone Alarm: set the alarm in "clock" application on the phone
- ...

Advice on working with the code:
