An App that shares schedule notifications with friends

The homepage of the webapp contains the introduction of GauchoAlarm, and the instruction of how to use our webapp.

In the navigation bar at the top, there are two tabs: "Create An Alarm" and "Join An Alarm"

# How to run GauchoAlarm
Start by clicking on "Create An Alarm" at the top.
Users can set the date, time and purpose of the alarm. Then the system will automatically return a unique key.
After recieving the unique key that GauchoAlarm generates, you may send your code to your friends,
so that they will be alerted by the alarm to hang out. 

If you have a code from someone who has made an alarm then click on "Join An Alarm".
Then, input the unique key will be given to you. ( i.e. 8914223145) 

# How to Run Source Code: Set up Database through MongoDB
# 1. Creating environment variables locally
Since we're going to be logging into a remote database, we have to hide our login credentials from the outside world. To do this, we're going to make a ```.env``` file inside our project directory. It should have a structure similar to this.
```
USER_=<your user's username>
PASS_=<your user's password>
DB_NAME_=<your db name>
HOST_=<your host name> // should be something with mlab in it...
```
__!!! IMPORTANT !!!__
Make sure to run the following to add ```.env``` to your .gitignore! This way our secret credentials won't be pushed into our GitHub repos.
```
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```
# 2. Additions to pom.xml
If you forked the project, you must add the following lines to your pom.xml inside the ```<dependencies>``` tag.
```XML
<!-- MongoDB NoSQL Database -->
 <dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>
        <artifactId>mongo-java-driver</artifactId>
        <version>3.8.1</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>
```
